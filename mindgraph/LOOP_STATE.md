STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
STAGE: 4 — Dashboard around absence (Stages 0-3 complete) (Stages 0 and 1 complete; dist/index.html now exists)
CHECKLIST:
- [x] init.scaffold — pipeline/ dist/ fixtures/ tools/ created; RESEARCH_REPORT.md installed
- [x] init.fixtures — synthetic dataset covering every required edge case (fixtures/fleet.json)
- [x] init.verifier — tools/verify created, self-test passes on 14 planted faults
- [x] 0.1 — encoding contract as CODE: a validator that refuses to emit a visual property when its backing field is null, and forces the UNKNOWN construction (hatched interior, broken border, "?")
- [x] 0.2 — build fails unless 100% of node/edge visual properties have a named backing field (report §6 Stage 0 threshold)
- [x] 1.1 — pipeline: derive traversal graph from the event log
- [x] 1.2 — pipeline: offline layout, deterministic seeding only (weighted centroid of positioned neighbours; perimeter by hash of stable ID; never Math.random)
- [x] 1.3 — pipeline: carry previous_x/previous_y forward; bounded relaxation within a hard displacement budget of ~1 node diameter per layout version; store layout_reason
- [x] 1.4 — pipeline: embed graph + positions + history + generated_at + data_through + expected interval in a <script type="application/json"> block
- [x] 2.1 — d3-force NOT vendored, and that is the resolution: the delivered file runs no simulation, so it would be 8300 bytes of dead code. Replaced by a permanent ban on runtime-layout primitives (see DECISIONS.md)
- [x] 2.2 — hand-written Canvas renderer: node channels per §4.1 (position/radius/fill/border/interior glyph/birth flag; ≤3 preattentive variables; no glow, ever)
- [x] 2.3 — two-layer edge model per §4.2: history rail width = log1p(lifetime_traversal_count), activity core luminance = recency
- [x] 2.4 — the five endpoint states, each visually distinct: never-observed / dormant / retired / unknown / stale
- [x] 2.5 — mid-edge gate glyph as a RECTANGLE (§3c verdict B), states [H…] [H✓] [H✗] [H!] [H↶]
- [x] 2.6 — legend with concrete worked examples, windows, numbers, and every log/sqrt transform and cap printed
- [x] 3.1 — persistence: a file reopened later renders pixel-identical node positions (threshold: zero coordinate drift between two opens)
- [x] 3.2 — birth-flag tab ("NEW"/"3h"/"2d") computed from now − first_seen_at against embedded generated_at; static, not a halo (§3d verdict B)
- [x] 3.3 — staleness self-display: all visible ages computed from embedded timestamps; never labelled LIVE
- [ ] 4.1 — dashboard: registry LEFT-JOIN telemetry; coverage + freshness strip first
- [ ] 4.2 — dashboard: exception queue (rollbacks, gate-eval errors, stale reporting, long-pending decisions) — NOT ordinary rejections
- [ ] 4.3 — dashboard: CONSORT-style cohort flow, neutral colours for expected rejection branches, red only for operationally abnormal (§3b verdict B)
- [ ] 4.4 — dashboard: Shewhart process-stability bands beneath the flow
- [ ] 4.5 — dashboard: fleet table with state-timelines; stale repos float to TOP; never retain a last green fill as dominant after reporting stops
- [ ] 4.6 — loop-vs-human panel labelled OBSERVATIONAL; disclose that the direct-human-edit counterfactual is not stored
- [ ] 5.1 — temporal mode 1: default accumulated present
- [ ] 5.2 — temporal mode 2: two-date difference-map, two synced panes (primary "what changed")
- [ ] 5.3 — temporal mode 3: opt-in scrubber, staged transitions, explicit user action only; respect prefers-reduced-motion; all static end-states fully interpretable
- [ ] 6.1 — dual themes via prefers-color-scheme with identical semantic ordering (§3f verdict B)
- [ ] 6.2 — MANUAL: on-hardware polarity A/B (light vs dark) for "find the abandoned path" and "find the missing-reporting node"
- [ ] 6.3 — MANUAL: comparison-mode A/B (difference-map vs two-pane vs scrubber) measured on error rate and time, not FPS
NEXT: 4.1 — dashboard: registry LEFT-JOIN telemetry; coverage + freshness strip first. fixtures/fleet.json already carries the registry with all four telemetry states (fresh/stale/never/error); 4.1 builds the strip from a left join so a repo that stops reporting cannot vanish.
BLOCKERS: none
MANUAL_CHECKS:
- (CLOSED 2026-08-05) headless browser load — Google Chrome was found at /Applications/Google Chrome.app. The verifier now opens dist/index.html from file:// headless with NetworkService disabled, twice, and compares canvas pixels. This is no longer a manual check.
- 6.2 and 6.3 are operator task-tests on target hardware and cannot be automated
LAST_RUN: 2026-08-05 — increment 3.3, STAGE 3 COMPLETE. Staleness self-display audited and PROVED by simulation: Date.now is overridden before the page script runs and the DOM is read back. Opened +3d the stamp says '3d ago'; opened +30d it says '30d ago'. Inspecting the code would only have shown that an age function exists.
The 3.2 rule is now enforced structurally: exactly ONE live clock read in the whole page, and it is inside age(), which only the header stamp uses. Everything describing a thing IN the picture is baked. Audited every visible age and classified it — nothing was misfiled.
One cosmetic defect fixed: the legend printed '14.0-day', which reads as a measurement taken to one decimal place. It is a configured integer, and the float suggested the boundary was finer than it is.
Verified: self-test PASS (24 detections); verify 152/152 PASS. Published to the stable URL.
