STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
STAGE: 4 — Dashboard around absence (Stages 0-3 complete) (Stages 0 and 1 complete; dist/index.html now exists)
CHECKLIST:
- [x] init.scaffold — pipeline/ dist/ fixtures/ tools/ created; RESEARCH_REPORT.md installed
- [x] init.fixtures — synthetic dataset covering every required edge case (fixtures/fleet.json)
- [x] init.verifier — tools/verify created, self-test passes on 14 planted faults
- [x] 0.1 — encoding contract as CODE: a validator that refuses to emit a visual property when its backing field is null, and forces the UNKNOWN construction (hatched interior, broken border, "?")
- [x] 0.2 — build fails unless 100% of node/edge visual properties have a named backing field (report §6 Stage 0 threshold)
- [x] 1.1 — pipeline: derive traversal graph from the event log
- [x] 1.2 — pipeline: offline layout, deterministic seeding only (weighted centroid of positioned neighbours; perimeter by hash of stable ID; never Math.random)
- [x] 1.3 — pipeline: carry previous_x/previous_y forward; bounded relaxation within a hard displacement budget of ~1 node diameter per layout version; store layout_reason
- [x] 1.4 — pipeline: embed graph + positions + history + generated_at + data_through + expected interval in a <script type="application/json"> block
- [x] 2.1 — d3-force NOT vendored, and that is the resolution: the delivered file runs no simulation, so it would be 8300 bytes of dead code. Replaced by a permanent ban on runtime-layout primitives (see DECISIONS.md)
- [x] 2.2 — hand-written Canvas renderer: node channels per §4.1 (position/radius/fill/border/interior glyph/birth flag; ≤3 preattentive variables; no glow, ever)
- [x] 2.3 — two-layer edge model per §4.2: history rail width = log1p(lifetime_traversal_count), activity core luminance = recency
- [x] 2.4 — the five endpoint states, each visually distinct: never-observed / dormant / retired / unknown / stale
- [x] 2.5 — mid-edge gate glyph as a RECTANGLE (§3c verdict B), states [H…] [H✓] [H✗] [H!] [H↶]
- [x] 2.6 — legend with concrete worked examples, windows, numbers, and every log/sqrt transform and cap printed
- [x] 3.1 — persistence: a file reopened later renders pixel-identical node positions (threshold: zero coordinate drift between two opens)
- [x] 3.2 — birth-flag tab ("NEW"/"3h"/"2d") computed from now − first_seen_at against embedded generated_at; static, not a halo (§3d verdict B)
- [x] 3.3 — staleness self-display: all visible ages computed from embedded timestamps; never labelled LIVE
- [x] 4.1 — dashboard: registry LEFT-JOIN telemetry; coverage + freshness strip first
- [x] 4.2 — dashboard: exception queue (rollbacks, gate-eval errors, stale reporting, long-pending decisions) — NOT ordinary rejections
- [x] 4.3 — dashboard: CONSORT-style cohort flow, neutral colours for expected rejection branches, red only for operationally abnormal (§3b verdict B)
- [x] 4.4 — dashboard: stability BANDS (not control charts — no series exists; see DECISIONS.md) beneath the flow
- [x] 4.5 — fleet table with FRESHNESS RAILS (state-timeline needs history the registry lacks; see DECISIONS.md); stale repos float to TOP; never retain a last green fill as dominant after reporting stops
- [ ] 4.6 — loop-vs-human panel labelled OBSERVATIONAL; disclose that the direct-human-edit counterfactual is not stored
- [ ] 5.1 — temporal mode 1: default accumulated present
- [ ] 5.2 — temporal mode 2: two-date difference-map, two synced panes (primary "what changed")
- [ ] 5.3 — temporal mode 3: opt-in scrubber, staged transitions, explicit user action only; respect prefers-reduced-motion; all static end-states fully interpretable
- [ ] 6.1 — dual themes via prefers-color-scheme with identical semantic ordering (§3f verdict B)
- [ ] 6.2 — MANUAL: on-hardware polarity A/B (light vs dark) for "find the abandoned path" and "find the missing-reporting node"
- [ ] 6.3 — MANUAL: comparison-mode A/B (difference-map vs two-pane vs scrubber) measured on error rate and time, not FPS
NEXT: 4.6 — loop-vs-human panel, labelled OBSERVATIONAL. fixtures/fleet.json already carries loop_vs_human with counterfactual_stored=false, so the panel must disclose that the direct-human-edit counterfactual is NOT stored and that this is an adjusted association, never a causal claim.
BLOCKERS: none
MANUAL_CHECKS:
- (CLOSED 2026-08-05) headless browser load — Google Chrome was found at /Applications/Google Chrome.app. The verifier now opens dist/index.html from file:// headless with NetworkService disabled, twice, and compares canvas pixels. This is no longer a manual check.
- 6.2 and 6.3 are operator task-tests on target hardware and cannot be automated
LAST_RUN: 2026-08-05 — increment 4.5. §4.4 asks for two things per repo and the registry supports one. A Grafana-style state TIMELINE needs a SEQUENCE of transitions — that is what makes duration-as-length meaningful, because the lengths sit side by side. The registry carries one last_report_at per repo and no transitions. Checked, not assumed.
Built the FRESHNESS RAIL, which is the half carrying the requirement's substance: bar length = how long the repo has held its CURRENT state, scaled across the fleet so the longest-quiet has the longest bar. marlin at 7d13h renders 100%; raptor and voltbot render ~0%. Normalising each row to its own maximum would have flattened exactly the climb that is the signal.
A repo that NEVER reported gets no bar at all — zero length would read as 'held this state for no time', and a full bar would invent a duration nobody measured. It gets the broken outline and no score, matching §4.4's 'NEVER REPORTED with no score'.
Probe found nothing: never-reported draws no bar and reports None rather than 0; a stale repo cannot keep the healthy treatment; the longest-quiet repo has the longest bar; no segment carries a series; and the page states the timeline it cannot draw.
Verified: self-test PASS (24 detections); verify 217/217 PASS. Published to the stable URL.
