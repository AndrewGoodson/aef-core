STATUS: IN_PROGRESS
STAGE: 4 — Dashboard around absence (Stages 0-3 complete) (Stages 0 and 1 complete; dist/index.html now exists)
CHECKLIST:
- [x] init.scaffold — pipeline/ dist/ fixtures/ tools/ created; RESEARCH_REPORT.md installed
- [x] init.fixtures — synthetic dataset covering every required edge case (fixtures/fleet.json)
- [x] init.verifier — tools/verify created, self-test passes on 14 planted faults
- [x] 0.1 — encoding contract as CODE: a validator that refuses to emit a visual property when its backing field is null, and forces the UNKNOWN construction (hatched interior, broken border, "?")
- [x] 0.2 — build fails unless 100% of node/edge visual properties have a named backing field (report §6 Stage 0 threshold)
- [x] 1.1 — pipeline: derive traversal graph from the event log
- [x] 1.2 — pipeline: offline layout, deterministic seeding only (weighted centroid of positioned neighbours; perimeter by hash of stable ID; never Math.random)
- [x] 1.3 — pipeline: carry previous_x/previous_y forward; bounded relaxation within a hard displacement budget of ~1 node diameter per layout version; store layout_reason
- [x] 1.4 — pipeline: embed graph + positions + history + generated_at + data_through + expected interval in a <script type="application/json"> block
- [x] 2.1 — d3-force NOT vendored, and that is the resolution: the delivered file runs no simulation, so it would be 8300 bytes of dead code. Replaced by a permanent ban on runtime-layout primitives (see DECISIONS.md)
- [x] 2.2 — hand-written Canvas renderer: node channels per §4.1 (position/radius/fill/border/interior glyph/birth flag; ≤3 preattentive variables; no glow, ever)
- [x] 2.3 — two-layer edge model per §4.2: history rail width = log1p(lifetime_traversal_count), activity core luminance = recency
- [x] 2.4 — the five endpoint states, each visually distinct: never-observed / dormant / retired / unknown / stale
- [x] 2.5 — mid-edge gate glyph as a RECTANGLE (§3c verdict B), states [H…] [H✓] [H✗] [H!] [H↶]
- [x] 2.6 — legend with concrete worked examples, windows, numbers, and every log/sqrt transform and cap printed
- [x] 3.1 — persistence: a file reopened later renders pixel-identical node positions (threshold: zero coordinate drift between two opens)
- [x] 3.2 — birth-flag tab ("NEW"/"3h"/"2d") computed from now − first_seen_at against embedded generated_at; static, not a halo (§3d verdict B)
- [x] 3.3 — staleness self-display: all visible ages computed from embedded timestamps; never labelled LIVE
- [x] 4.1 — dashboard: registry LEFT-JOIN telemetry; coverage + freshness strip first
- [x] 4.2 — dashboard: exception queue (rollbacks, gate-eval errors, stale reporting, long-pending decisions) — NOT ordinary rejections
- [x] 4.3 — dashboard: CONSORT-style cohort flow, neutral colours for expected rejection branches, red only for operationally abnormal (§3b verdict B)
- [ ] 4.4 — dashboard: Shewhart process-stability bands beneath the flow
- [ ] 4.5 — dashboard: fleet table with state-timelines; stale repos float to TOP; never retain a last green fill as dominant after reporting stops
- [ ] 4.6 — loop-vs-human panel labelled OBSERVATIONAL; disclose that the direct-human-edit counterfactual is not stored
- [ ] 5.1 — temporal mode 1: default accumulated present
- [ ] 5.2 — temporal mode 2: two-date difference-map, two synced panes (primary "what changed")
- [ ] 5.3 — temporal mode 3: opt-in scrubber, staged transitions, explicit user action only; respect prefers-reduced-motion; all static end-states fully interpretable
- [ ] 6.1 — dual themes via prefers-color-scheme with identical semantic ordering (§3f verdict B)
- [ ] 6.2 — MANUAL: on-hardware polarity A/B (light vs dark) for "find the abandoned path" and "find the missing-reporting node"
- [ ] 6.3 — MANUAL: comparison-mode A/B (difference-map vs two-pane vs scrubber) measured on error rate and time, not FPS
NEXT: 4.4 — Shewhart process-stability bands beneath the flow. NOTE: the cohort record carries per-window counts but no time series, so a control chart over successive windows may not be derivable — if not, report the absence rather than inventing a series.
BLOCKERS: none
MANUAL_CHECKS:
- (CLOSED 2026-08-05) headless browser load — Google Chrome was found at /Applications/Google Chrome.app. The verifier now opens dist/index.html from file:// headless with NetworkService disabled, twice, and compares canvas pixels. This is no longer a manual check.
- 6.2 and 6.3 are operator task-tests on target hardware and cannot be automated
LAST_RUN: 2026-08-05 — increment 4.3. The cohort flow is CONSORT-style per §3b verdict B, not a funnel. A funnel's grammar says wider top is success and everything leaking out is loss, which is BACKWARDS here — it would draw the system working correctly as a system leaking. CONSORT treats every exclusion as an expected, counted, reason-annotated branch.
Colour carries abnormality, never rejection: in-band rejection branches are neutral, and red is reserved for a rollback or a rate outside its own band. Colouring rejections red would re-import the funnel's claim through the palette after removing it from the shape. Verified both ways — an in-band rejection is never drawn abnormal, and a rate that has left its band IS.
Every proposal accounted for: 412 = 191+96+41+12+68+4 + 0 unclassified. The unclassified row renders EVEN AT ZERO, because a hidden zero is indistinguishable from a figure nobody computed. An unaccounted remainder is surfaced rather than absorbed — proved with a synthetic cohort where 5 go missing.
A branch with no historical range reads UNKNOWN, not in-band: it has not been compared to anything, and saying it is within expectations would be a claim nobody made.
REGRESSION CAUGHT AND FIXED: inserting the flow above the canvas pushed the birth tab out of the 1400px screenshot viewport, so its pixel diff measured 0. It FAILED SAFE, but a check that can silently start measuring an empty region is this project's cardinal failure pointed at the verifier. Capture size is now decided in one place at 3200px, and the crop offset is generous rather than tight.
Not derivable, reported: median and p-high time-in-stage — the cohort record carries no per-stage durations.
Verified: self-test PASS (24 detections); verify 192/192 PASS. Published to the stable URL.
