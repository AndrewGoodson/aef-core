## I1 — Task metric (2026-09-03)

**Branch:** `improve/i1-task-metric`, off `main` (`2c3fc4b`).
**Rubric claim:** dimension 1, up to +7. Total before: 50.

**Reproduce (RUN, before any change).** The corpus score was
`task_completion`, which `RuleBasedEvaluator` sets to 1.0 whenever the plan
finished with no errors. A graph that ran cleanly and wrote the wrong answer
scored 1.0. `tests/harness/test_task_checks.py::
test_without_checks_a_clean_wrong_answer_scores_full_marks` pins this and is
kept as the control: without an owner claim about the answer, scoring lower
would invent one.

**Expectation.** Owner-declared, data-only `checks` on a scenario (dotted
path into final state; `equals`/`contains`/`regex`/`exists`) and a
runner-measured `budget_ms`; one `score_scenario()` used by both the
in-process runner and the isolated gate path so they cannot drift; `aef loop
score` printing the scalar per split with n, stdev, CI95, and — under
`--repeat` — the spread of the mean across identical runs. Expected: the
demo corpus scores deterministically (spread 0), and a planted
clean-run-wrong-content fault moves the score on exactly the checked
scenarios and nowhere else.

**Measurement.**

```
aef loop score agents.demo.graph:build_graph --corpus corpus --repeat 3
  train       n=6   with_checks=3   mean=0.5000 stdev=0.5477 ci95=[0.0617, 0.9383] repeat_spread=0.000000
  validation  n=5   with_checks=2   mean=0.4000 stdev=0.5477 ci95=[-0.0801, 0.8801] repeat_spread=0.000000

planted: agents/demo success path writes scores.quality=0.0 (clean run, wrong content)
  train       mean=0.1667   boundary-3 1.0->0.0, easy-1 1.0->0.5, easy-2 1.0->0.5, others unchanged
  validation  mean=0.1000   val-boundary 1.0->0.0, val-easy 1.0->0.5, others unchanged
reverted; diff -q against backup: identical

mutations on score_scenario (each -> test fails, reverted):
  M8  ignore the check fraction        3 failed
  M9  ignore the wall-clock budget     1 failed
  M10 let checks override an error     1 failed

pytest -q          1638 passed (from 1618; +20, none removed)
mypy aef examples  122 files clean
ruff check / format --check   clean
```

**What the numbers say.** The CI at n=6 is [0.06, 0.94] — the docstring in
`evaluation.py` was right that means have no power at this size, and the
number that matters for an increment is `repeat_spread`, which is 0 for a
deterministic graph under a pinned clock. Any claimed improvement must
exceed 0 here; on a graph with a non-deterministic node it will be larger,
and `--repeat` is how it gets stated rather than assumed.

**Verdict.** Metric exists, is read by one function in both scoring paths,
can fail without an error, and moves on a planted content fault. Dimension 1:
8 → **13** (not the +7 claimed: a fixed suite with a scalar and a budget is
done; keep/revert on the metric is I2, and the corpus is still 11 demo
scenarios — the checks are only as good as the owner's claims, and there are
five). Total: **50 → 55**.

**Deliberately left.** Checks on the `hard-*` and `tripwire-*` scenarios:
they are `must_fail`-shaped and fail by error today; a check would restate
that. `Expected.MUST_PASS` on the checked ones: `expected` and `checks` say
different things (a claim about the task vs. a claim about the answer) and
conflating them is a separate decision. ADR 0113 records both.

## I2 — Keep/revert on the metric, inside the gates (2026-09-03)

**Branch:** `improve/i2-keep-revert`, off `main` (`346da37`).
**Rubric claim:** dimension 1, up to +5. Total before: 55.

**Reproduce (RUN).** `cycle()` proposes from `base_ref` every time and an
accepted candidate (every gate passed → `ESCALATE`, Tier-1 off) goes nowhere;
`test_successive_cycles_do_not_compound` pins it. autoresearch's result came
from stacking kept changes; this loop could not stack anything.

**Expectation.** `run_loop`: N turns / wall-clock budget; each turn proposes
from a local `loop/kept` branch; every-gate-passed advances that branch
(guarded `update-ref`, `KEPT` ledger event); rejection leaves it; `main`
never moves (asserted); stops on turns, budget, halt, no candidate, or a
candidate tree already rejected this run. Expected through the REAL cycle:
turn 1 keeps the structural retry, later turns propose from the kept state.

**Measurement.**

```
real cycle + real gates (flaky-agent fixture, tests/harness/test_structural_acceptance.py):
  turn 1  proposed structural retry from memory   -> every gate passed -> KEPT   loop/kept advanced
  turn 2  proposed numeric tweak FROM kept state   -> G3 rejected      -> reverted
  turn 3  re-proposed the identical tree           -> driver stopped: "already rejected in this run"
  kept 1, reverted 1; main unchanged; ledger: KEPT present, MERGED absent

driver (fake cycle, 9 tests): keep advances / revert holds / stack / AUTO_MERGE still not main /
  budget stop / no-candidate stop / halt stop / repeated-tree stop / second run resumes from kept

mutations on run_loop (each -> tests fail, reverted):
  M11 never advance kept                3 failed
  M12 propose from main, not kept       2 failed
  M13 ignore the repeated rejected tree 1 failed
  M14 ignore the wall-clock budget      1 failed

pytest -q          1648 passed (from 1638; +10, none removed)
mypy aef examples  122 files clean
ruff check / format   clean
```

**Verdict.** The loop stacks, is bounded five ways, and cannot reach main.
Dimension 1: 13 → **17**. Total: **55 → 59**. The last three points are
the material: eleven demo scenarios and a proposer that knows numeric
constants and one structural transformation.

**Deliberately left.** No `aef loop run` invocation on this repo's own
corpus in the log: it needs a blessed baseline and a failure-memory store,
which the fixture provides and the repo's checkout does not. The metric
trajectory per turn is in the ledger's `GATED` evidence, not yet surfaced
by `run_loop`'s summary.
